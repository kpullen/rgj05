This is my entry for the fifth [Reddit Game Jam](http://reddit.com/r/redditgamejam). My first 
attempt was [BearHug](http://github.com/kpullen/BearHug), but I realized that all was not well, so 
I rewrote it. This game is a simple key-clicker: You click the appropriate key at the appropriate 
time, much like DDR.

# backstory
Meet Paul. Paul is a bear. Paul loves people. Specifically, Paul loves to hug people, and even loves
high fives. He is so full of love that love even sometimes shoots out of his eyes. Help Paul spread
the love. HELP. HIM.
***
# keys
* Alternate L and R keys to get up to running speed to start spreading the love.
* H is for hug.
* F is for high/F/iving.
* Z fires torpedoes. Just kidding - it's for the love beams!
***
# technology!
This game requires [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) (tested on 1.9.2) and [Gosu](http://libgosu.org).
